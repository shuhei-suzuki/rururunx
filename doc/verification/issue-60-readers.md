# Issue60 selected Git reader lifetime verification

Status: requirements candidate UNAPPROVED; no implementation or acceptance.
Base2c6ae9d includes diagnostic partialPR61 and environment partialPR53. Their
independent approvals do not authorize this reader/owner-driver change. Parent60
and native16/F1/runtime-workload settlement remain OPEN.

Historical18c/b90/555 failures and every later CI failure remain FAILED/RED with
cause AND regression UNKNOWN. A reader JoinHandle source gap is verified
separately; no historical EOF writer, scheduling/inspection cause or regression
is identified by that observation.

Preparation: exclusive worktree issue-60, branchfix/issue-60-readers, from clean
main2c6ae9d. No source changes. Agent6 explicitly confirms approved StageA has no
common ProcessGroup/Drop/retained-child implementation/approval; StageB remains
required OPEN. Shared impact is consequently part of this independent design,
not an assumed dependency or silent helper edit.
