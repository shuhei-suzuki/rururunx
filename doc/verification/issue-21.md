# Issue 21 verification

Requirements draft only, baseline main80452f4/schema3. Public Issue21 depends on
merged2/4 and is runnable requirements work within MVP tracking parent17.

Actual AgentAdapter::usage contract is adapter.rs223–228; GenericAdapter838–864
returns scoped nullable metrics and prepared-input byte fields with explicit
missing native telemetry. Store::put_usage828–876 validates finite cost and own
Session scope/agent, then appends usage/audit; Session lookup precedes the write
transaction. Store::usage879–892 returns raw scoped rows without qualified
aggregation or pagination. Usage domain stores nullable fields and arbitrary
cache_metadata. These are existing foundations, not21 acceptance.

Context master sections9/12/15 and Product40.7–40.10 require native cache awareness,
attributable telemetry and representative ON/OFF comparison preserving safety and
quality. Existing external native resumed review counters have unverified per-round
attribution; this draft specifically requires semantics/boundaries before summing.
No native default, credential, permission or hook is changed.

Pending: requirements review, bounded durable/query/normalization design with19
epoch/producers, actual implementation and causal mutation/regression controls,
native quality comparison, exact-head CI and independent source review. No token
savings, billed cost, cache correctness, TUI or final16 dogfood claim.
