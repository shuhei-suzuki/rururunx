# Issue 46 verification

STRICT shared owned-process death evidence. Requirements/design proposed; no code,
formal review, mutation, default-suite or exact-head CI success yet.

Issue41 exact `888d86d` macOS CI37169413513 reported `native process inspection
 timed out` from bounded Context Git, followed by uncertainty cascades. Linux was
cancelled by failfast after successful tests/debug. Native Claude separately
observed default-parallel Git5s timeouts. Neither establishes causality.

Read-only installed macOS26.6.2 build25G83 own-group fixture used exactly
`/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.14` with waitid/WNOWAIT. Two fresh session leaders each
owned two children. Explicit `ps -g PGID -o pid=,pgid=,stat=` returned exactly the
three expected members, equalled global-table filtering and excluded the second
owned group. An unreaped zombie leader with two live S children remained visible.
Only those owned groups were signaled; cleanup was verified before leader reap.

Five sequential quiet samples: global1431rows median23.121ms; selected3rows
median3.761ms. These are local observations, not CI-load evidence or a production
performance guarantee. Source/result scripts remain temporary fixture evidence;
public structured evidence will be published with validated formal/implementation
rounds. Published Apple blobs are pinned in the design; installed binary/source
identity is unverified. XNU global traversal/temporary allocation remains explicit.

Existing-source safety gap: Apple ps can emit sysctl stderr yet return0, including
initial/exhausted failures. Retry can sleep1s on non-ENOMEM. Current discarded
stderr/empty-as-dead is not sufficient death proof. No shared helper changed yet,
no250ms deadline/latch/serialization relaxation and no historical root-cause claim.

## Requirements review1 and verified refinements

Immutable public `f844d4c` Requirements1 native session
`f5c3cbdd-df13-437f-a863-92ef89f38e2c` completed request_changes; owned cleanup was
verified. R46-1 High is a verified requirement omission: exact-group completeness
must include cross-UID/non-TTY members, which same-UID fixtures cannot establish.
Pinned Apple ps selector increments nselectors/xkeep_implied before default-owner
insertion; one-group optimization occurs afterward, then keepit bypasses UID
filtering. XNU PGRP callback has UID/TTY check flags zero. This source-scoped
verification is distinct from installed binary identity or privileged acceptance.

R46-2 Medium is verified: XNU skips SIDL/forking while collecting PIDs under lock,
then fills records after unlock with zombie fallback. The non-atomic fork/exit
window is now an explicit residual limitation. R46-3 Low partial-success KILL
non-claim and R46-4 Low observable error-category precision are also included;
inspection Unknown retains its category and maps to Lost, valid live returns
EPERM, no raw stderr or additional durable permission data. No code or runtime
evidence changed. Requirements2 delta re-review and design gate remain required.
